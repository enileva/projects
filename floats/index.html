        Let us consider the pen in front of me on my desk. What type of object is this pen? First of all, I may say that the pen is an object made in a certain way, with its own shape, colour and material. In saying this, I am using concepts which describe the physical world of things. The pen must also perform functions: it has been designed to write. But when I observe the pen, it tells me many other things. For example, that it has been constructed by somebody, and that this somebody is my contemporary: this pen is not an object from the Roman age or from ancient China. The material of which it is made, its manufacture, the way it works tell me that there must be somewhere an organization that produces things like pens. If we now shift our focus to this organization, the pen must be an object designed, manufactured and distributed so that it can be sold and end up on someone’s desk. In their turn, the points of view of the designer, of the production department and of the distribution department are different, and they describe my pen using different concepts. For the designer the pen is essentially an aesthetic and functional object; for the production department it is the outcome of materials processed in a certain way, etc. For the company producing the pen it is all these things together. For the shopkeeper who displays the pen on his shelves and seeks to sell it to customers, it is again different.

      <h2>
      An argument in favor of the approach by objects is the ease with which it is possible to pass from a object-based description to a process-based one: if a level is defined by items in interaction (where the items can be canonically conceived as objects), then a level can be defined by a dynamic. A multiplicity of structurally stable dynamics, at diverse levels of granularity, may define a multiplicity of levels. However, if it turns out that the structuring in levels does not respect a universal principle of linearity, then one is forced to restrict the multidynamic frames to their linear fragments. Which is precisely the situation of current theories of dynamic systems. On careful consideration, in fact, the predominant opinion is that there is only one multi-dynamic (multi-layered) system :the one described by the natural sciences. Other forms of knowledge are scientific to the extent that they can be located in the progressive series of supraformations (groups of groups of groups of items, each with its specific kinds of interaction). Hence the alternative :a discipline is scientific to the extent that it can be located in the series of aggregation levels – if so it can be more or less easily reduced to the base level – or it cannot be thus located and is consequently not a science : it has no citizenship in the realm of knowledge and is scientifically stateless.
