  <h1> Our Mission </h1>
    <p>Here at Hive Minded, our goal is to share our knowledge and love for beekeeping.
      We are dedicated to educating the public about the important role bees have in our precious ecosystem.
      For the past century, the bee population has been in danger as industrialism, pollution, climate change, and other threats encroach on their natural habitat.
      Beekeepers across nations have stepped in to provide a safe habitat for bees from outside interference.
      By purchasing from us, you become part of the mission to help save the bees. Hive Minded donates 100% of all profits to the Bee Conservancy organization.
    </p>
  <h1> The Bee Conservancy </h1>
    <img src="The-Bee-Conservancy-Logo-CMYK.png">
    <p> The Bee Conservancy is a non-profit organization that has donated hundreds of bee hives, opened many bee sanctuaries,
      and started the Ground Up campaign, and provided funding for scholarships that go towards prospective beekeepers. The ground up campaign is focused on
      protecting ground-dwelling bees, which make up 70% of the world's 20,000 bee species.
